Hello CRS Family!

My name is Alon Levin, and I was a camper at Red Hook in 2014; I am currently studying engineering at The Cooper Union in New York City.

For the past six weeks, my friend Benjamin Kaplan and I have been working on a biomedical device for an invention competition at our university. To keep things short, our device makes medication more easily accessible in case people, and especially children, with food allergies accidentally ingest something they are allergic to.

Our project won second place during the final judging phase, but we want to move forward with our invention and aid as many people as we possibly can. We would be extremely grateful if someone can point us toward someone in the community with a background in intellectual property law or biomedical engineering. We have filed a provisional patent application, and would like to start looking into next potential steps. As we are only starting in our engineering careers, and truly believe that our device can help save lives, we will appreciate any help that we can get.

We'd be glad to share more details with anyone who will be able to take the time to contact us. The best way to do this is by email at alon.s.levin@gmail.com or kaplan4@cooper.edu. Thank you everyone in advance!!! :)
